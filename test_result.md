# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Test the complete scheduled messages frontend functionality with German interface, including message creation, scheduling, warning system, and delivery verification."

frontend:
  - task: "Scheduled Messages Frontend Implementation"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "/app/frontend/src/App.js"

        - working: true
          agent: "testing"
          comment: "✅ Complete scheduled messages system tested successfully. German interface loads properly with beautiful UI including emojis and proper styling. Tab navigation works smoothly between Create, Scheduled (Geplant), and Delivered (Ausgeliefert) tabs. Form validation prevents empty submissions. Message creation works with proper datetime constraints (min time = now + 1 minute). Messages appear in scheduled list with proper warning system (yellow highlighting, bell icons) for messages due within 2 minutes. Tab counters update correctly. Delete functionality is present. Message delivery system works - messages move from scheduled to delivered status automatically. Minor: Warning message text 'Diese Nachricht wird bald ausgeliefert!' not always visible, and checkmark emoji not showing in delivered messages, but core functionality is solid."

backend:
  - task: "Scheduled Messages Backend API"
    implemented: true
    working: true

    status_history:
        - working: true
          agent: "testing"
          comment: "✅ Backend API working correctly. Message scheduler running in background, delivering messages on time. All API endpoints functional: POST /api/messages for creation, GET /api/messages for listing, DELETE /api/messages/{id} for deletion. Messages properly transition from 'scheduled' to 'delivered' status with delivered_at timestamps. Real-time updates working with 10-second refresh interval."

      message: "Comprehensive testing completed for scheduled messages system. All core functionality working properly. The German interface is beautiful and functional. Message creation, scheduling, warning system, and delivery all work as expected. Only minor cosmetic issues with warning text visibility and checkmark display in delivered messages, but these don't affect core functionality. System is ready for production use."
